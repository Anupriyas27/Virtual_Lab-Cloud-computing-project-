A microservices-based Virtual Lab platform that provides a modular, scalable, and containerized environment for managing virtual experiments. Built with React, Docker, and multiple backend services, it supports user profiling, intelligent scoring, personalized recommendations, and real-time notifications.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
This project consists of four microservices and a React frontend, all connected using Docker Compose for seamless orchestration.

🔧 Microservices:
1. 👤 Profile Management Service
Handles:

User registration, login & authentication

Profile updates

Session management

JWT-based authentication

REST API for frontend interaction

2. 🔔 Notification Service
Sends real-time alerts and updates to users

Notifies users about:

Experiment updates

Deadlines

Scoring feedback

Queued/async support (optional via Redis/RabbitMQ)

3. 🧠 Marks Calculation Service
Dynamically computes scores based on:

Experiment difficulty

Time taken

Accuracy

Applies weighted logic to calculate final marks

Stores and shares reports with other services

4. 🎯 Recommendation Service
Recommends:

Next experiments based on user performance

Difficulty adjustments

Learning paths or supplementary resources

Implements basic AI logic (e.g., rule-based or ML)

💻 Frontend (React)
User dashboard with:

Profile overview

Notifications panel

Experiment progress

Recommended experiments

REST API-based communication with backend

Responsive and interactive design
